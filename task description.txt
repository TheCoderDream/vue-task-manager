There are two views, one for login and one for logged user (account page).
To create this application you should use already prepared project where you can find component which you should use for tabs.
You can learn more about this component using 'storybook' npm task. Of course you can modify Tabs component for example to change styles of it.

Please remember to protect url before unauthorised user enter the account page.
